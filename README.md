# HTML & CSS CApstone project: Social Network

> The project is about building an HTML & CSS project for a social network site, based on a design design idea by [Vlad Ermakov on Dribbble ](https://dribbble.com/ermalength).

## Social Network Concept.

The original design considers a dating social network. I have used the original design requirement and followed the capstone project challenge to redefine the social network for my solution. 

In my project, I considered the concept of servicing a charity branch in a private organization ([Rayces](https://rayces.com)), that offers educational services and medical therapy for children patients with learning disabilities. This company has children patients, and my novel idea is that also, the organization creates a charity branch that gives free treatment to a small number of children using funds from the private company itself but also funds rising campaigns organized by the company. This social network targets families an individuals that want to donate money to support the treatment of children patients. The network gives a chance for the donors to get in touch with the children's tutors, and receive information about the treatment progress, health checkup updates, and chat messaging contact between the donor and the children's tutor. This network could also be applied to private patients to get the benefit of a centralized system for tutors to get information about their children's treatment progress.

## Application Engineering - Key Notes

>Main Page responsive strategy.
- The main page has a navbar and footer and a modal box with user information for all mobile screens up to 767px displays.
- For screens bigger than 768, the screen would lose its modal box, footprint, and the "scroll menu" would appear at the bottom of the image, absolute positioned relative to the main image container.

 >Main page's film reel

- The main page has a film reel with pictures that shows on all mobile screens. Here, I have used a flexbox, that would adjust the bases of each element according to the available space. Each picture has little padding that ensures a visible gap between them. The small cancel icon shown for the image in focus has been build with pseudocode after the image wrap, and absolute positioned relative to the in-focus image wrap. The top and bottom parameters are adjusted depending on the screen sizes. 
- For screens less than 320 px, an in-focus image is shown and an additional three pictures.
- From 320 px to 499 px, in-focus image plus 4 additional pictures.
- From 768 px screens onwards, in-focus image, and an additional six pictures in the film reel.

> Using Full-Screen Height

Problem: We need each page to contain 100% of the view port's height, so we have a typical app UX.
For this problem, the solution applied was, using 100% of the view port's height using flex.
- So, I defined a container, with a display type flex with column direction, using a height of 100vh, and making sure I use no margins top or bottom in the container. Any margin at all would create an overflow that would break the container 100vh definition.
- This solution allows for any sub-container to be aligned using flex properties and making sure all the content would fit in the current viewport's size.


> Main hero image on user pages

Problem: Positioning hero image with a bigger than 50% screen size, but still being able to show the modal box (detail person information) and avoiding breaking when we switch to smaller screens.
Solution: 
- Initially, I was trying to set up a relative image height using vh unit. Although the solution  worked, it was complex to keep without breaking on smaller screens.
- The final solution was to fix the header and footer size of the main page, using the right icon sizes and padding, while letting the hero image (main image) be adjusted by the flex container. Also, I needed to fix the height of the modal, so its relative container does not get shrink when screen size reduces in height for different screen sizes. 
- This solution is simple enough to maintain and does not require additional code at different media sizes.

> Organizing the messages page for media >1024px

- To make the messages page scroll inside the container while in media >1024, I needed to assign to the main page inside the section, a specific size of 62vh (considering the nab-var height. 
- Also Inside the messages container (msg-frame class), I included the property overflow-y to enable the scroll effect.
- Finally, I work all the height parameters in each modal-message (modal-msg) to  "auto," so, in that way, there is no fixed height, and the msg-frame would have all messages placed in order and with the same size one after the other.
- The complete frame would overflow from the main-page section (msg-frame) container, achieving the scroll effect. 
- Finally, I positioned the footer and the menu relative to its parent container. So, it gets rendered in continuation to the main page section with a little 2% offset to compensate for the required margin-top and bottom to align the icons.

> Basic Demo Navigability 

- I used Java Script to organize a basic solution. 
- In mobile, the main page shows when we click the chat icon on the main page.
- From the message page, we could come back to the main page by clicking the engage icon.
- We can go to the detail chat page by clicking any message group on the message page. Currently, we go to the same page.
- We go back from the chat page to the messages page by clicking the back arrow.
- For screens bigger than 768px, we use Grid as the primary placing solution and, the main-page and user page take each 50% of the screen width. 
- For screens >=1024 px, three grid columns organize Menu-bar, main-page, and user page from left to right. 
- If we click the chat option in the menu, a small Javascript code will change the display property to "none" (display=none) for the main page and the user page and also will display as a block (display = block) both the messages page and chat page. So messages and chat should render in the correspondent columns 2 and 3 of the frame for the big screen sizes.
- When the user clicks on the "support our children" icon on the menu-bar, the process the inverse one, and javascript would then allow to display=none the messages and chat pages and display=flex the main-page and user-page.
- From PC to mobile: (only for demo purposes) Messages page and chat page gests display=none in the basic mobile.

> Key grid solution to switch from user-layout to message-layout on big screens

Problem: How to manage different layout "grid-column-size" configuration by using the same media query configuration?

General navigability solution:

- When the screen is >1024, the links "support our children" and "messages" are detected by a Javascript function and will add the classes layout-message-page and layout-user-page to the #general-layout container correspondently. 
- These classes will modify the current grid-template-column definition to the specific percentage distribution according to the required layout (user or message). 
- At the same time, JS will also display=none all the appropriate section semantics containing the HTML tags for each design.
